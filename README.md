### Intro
Many players in Apex Legends think that ring defines randomly or in fixed places. But one times i heard that Bloodhound said something like "There is no one in the Ring. Lets go there." How can creators of this game made this phrase if ring is random or fixed? It should be very low probability to happen what from near 60 people. So i thought this is the phisics of Ring - center of it defined in the point maximum farthets from all another players on map.
And later i checked it in Crypto's Map Room location at Kings Canyon map. If u try to showing the location of all Legends using map inside strictly after the new Ring timer starts u see that very often in Ring inside clear from legends. So like all other phisics in this game it make people moveing more and fighting more as result.
So i made this app and check that it not works preciesly=) Looks like the algorithm use not only players possition and middle point between them, but more another variables like may be player kills to make point more weight or something like this.
May be later developers reveal this part of phisics and i will finish it. Or it will be another in-game hints.
Until then I'll just leave it here - my first Qt app. :)
